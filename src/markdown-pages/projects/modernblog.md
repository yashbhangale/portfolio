### Overview
Modern-blog app features recent posts, categories. full markdown articles, author information, comments, and much more,
this app is made with NextJs, Tailwind css, GraphQl and GraphCMS
while developing this app I learned how to work with GraphCMS. 
(GraphCMS is a headless content management system based on GraphQL technology enabling seamless integration with any application.)
Designed this app eith tailwind css,and deployed it on vercel.
In this app I also have also wrote some post related to cyber security for testing purposes
